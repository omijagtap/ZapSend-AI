🚀 **I upgraded my "weekend project" into a full-blown platform.**

A while back, I shared **ZapSend AI** — a simple tool I built because I was tired of complicated email marketing apps. I just wanted to send personalized emails without the headache.

But as I used it, I realized I needed *more*.

I didn't just want to send emails *now*; I wanted to schedule them for tomorrow morning. I wanted to save my best templates. And honestly? I wanted it to look and feel like a professional product, not just a script.

So, I went back to the code.

**Introducing ZapSend AI V2.** ⚡

It’s the same simple philosophy, but now with the power features I was missing:

✅ **Schedule Sending:** Pick a date & time, set your timezone, and let it run automatically.
✅ **Campaign Management:** Save templates and recipient lists. Reuse what works.
✅ **Professional UI:** A complete redesign. Dark mode, sleek animations, and a focus on focus.
✅ **Smart Guide:** A built-in "How to Use" documentation right on the home page.
✅ **Security First:** Still 100% client-side. Your credentials never leave your browser.

🛠️ **Why I'm sharing this**

Not to pitch anything.

But because sometimes, when the workflow feels heavier than the work itself, building your own solution can be surprisingly empowering.

I built this to solve my own friction, but seeing it evolve from a "quick fix" to a robust platform has been an incredible journey.

If anyone wants the setup guide or the technical breakdown of the new V2 features, just comment “ZapSendAI” and I’ll share it.
